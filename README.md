# links2md

Simple tool to convert a list of links to a markdown formatted list with page's titles.

## Why?

I used it once to begin my repository [awesome-graduenz](https://github.com/graduenz/awesome-graduenz) with some links I have been bookmarking.

## Getting started

In `Program.cs`, change the `links` variable content to the list of links. Then, `dotnet run`. Magic!
